# Morse Code Learning Program (Python)
*A simple project for me to learn more advanced Python features & for learning morse code*

---

This project is split into two parts: [Noise Synthesis](#noise-synthesis) & [Learning](#learning)

---

The program when downloaded should have the following file structure:

```
Root
├─── synthesis
│    ├─*─ sounds
│    │    └─*─ (.wav files)
│    ├─── clear.py
│    └─── generate.py
└─── learn_morse.py

─── = Downloaded
─*─ = Created after program is run for the first time
```

## Noise Synthesis

These scripts are located in <img src="images/icons8-folder-48.png" width="16">**`/synthesis`** & are responsible for generating morse code audio for dots, dashes, spaces & allows generating custom morse code audio from text 

<img src="images/icons8-python-48.png" width="16">**`generate.py`** is responsible for creating the audio files which are required to use the learning program.

<img src="images/icons8-python-48.png" width="16">**`clear.py`** will remove the <img src="images/icons8-folder-48.png" width="16">**`/sounds`** folder & all the files in the directory to make the program easier to move & smaller.

<img src="images/icons8-python-48.png" width="16">**`custom.py`** allows the creation of custom audio created from a string input into the console. The custom sound will be placed in the <img src="images/icons8-folder-48.png" width="16">**`/sounds`** folder, the file will be named after the string used to generate the sound with a '#' added to the start to make locating it easier.

## Learning

**At the moment this section is incomplete & WIP**

## Credits

All code written in this program (excluding external libraries) were written by me
